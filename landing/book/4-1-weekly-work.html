<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Weekly work</h2>
<p>Each week, you will complete (with certain caveats, as detailed in the <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca">workbook</a>)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>exercises <strong>that are appropriate to your tech level</strong>. How do you know if it was appropriate? If the exercise was easy, then you do the next one. You <em>push</em> yourself until you get to the point where you are stumped. You will keep a fail log and an online notebook for the exercises. The point here is not to stump you, but to push you from your current comfort level.</li>
<li>collaborative reading assignments, which you will demonstrate that you have done via collaborative web annotations of either the fail logs, notebooks, or assigned readings. Exercises are organized by modules, and the sequence of modules reflects the sequence of doing digital history.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>nb</strong> there must be evidence from each module that you have fully engaged with the exercises and the collaborative reading. How to demonstrate this evidence will be covered below. A checklist of what should be completed by when is provided below. Work <strong>must</strong> be completed in a timely manner. Follow, and keep to, the schedule.</p>
<div id="more-about-the-fail-log-and-notebook" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> More about the fail log and notebook</h3>
<p>You will keep the fail log in a repository on <strong>Github</strong> that details the work you do for each module. What can go into this? Everything and anything. Files you create. Notes you make to yourself on how to use a particular tool. Random thoughts as they occur. I call it a ‘fail log’ because more often than not, things don’t work at first. We learn by trying, by failing productively, as it were. In essence, there are many ways to craft digital history; you need to leave yourself breadcrumbs so that you can return to a project after a hiatus and know what it was you were doing/thinking at the time. Caleb McDaniel calls this <a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html">open notebook history</a> and you should read that post of his before going any further. FYI, here’s my own repository for my research: <a href="http://github.com/shawngraham" class="uri">http://github.com/shawngraham</a>.</p>
<p>You should also keep a narrative of your research that connects the dots and explains the thinking behind what you were trying to do (and what you documented in your fail log); think of this as your lab notebook. A blogging platform is a good way of doing that. FYI, here’s mine: <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca">Electric Archaeology</a>; I’ve tried another variation on the model <a href="http://smgprojects.github.io">here</a>. There is no <em>one</em> correct way to do this; you will have to work to find a way that feels authentic to you.</p>
<p>The modules in the workbook contain readings, and exercises aimed at various levels of comfort with things digital. That is to say, if you’ve never done anything with your computer other than updating Facebook, there are exercises designed to introduce you to computing; if you are doing a computer science minor on the side, there are exercises designed to challenge you too. The idea is that you work through the exercises <strong>until you get stumped</strong>. You detail where you were at and how you got stumped, in your narrative in your notebook. You ask each other for help, encourage each other, and discuss the exercises, in our Slack space.</p>
<p>I am not interested so much in your final product as <strong>I am interested in your progress</strong>. The assessment of the fail log and the notebook is not on whether you end up with a ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ piece, but rather, how you have grown and challenged yourself. Should you be someone for whom the exercises hold no challenge, then I challenge you to <strong>write the next exercise yourself</strong>. I’m always learning: I would be disappointed if I learned nothing from all of you. Again, the challenge of these modules: <strong>you must push yourself beyond your comfort level</strong>. That is what I am looking to assess. If I see that you are only trying the minimum level when it is apparent that you could be pushing further, that will be deemed unsatisfactory.</p>

<div id="more-about-the-collaborative-readings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> More about the collaborative readings</h3>
<p>Digital history is not done in isolation. In contrast to other courses you may have done, <strong>I expect you to collaborate</strong>, to help each other out, to problem solve, to draw each other’s attention to the important points. In the first instance, annotating the readings and workbook make this experience more like a study group. In the second, I’m quite content that you should help each other out with the exercises. <strong>Really?!</strong> I hear you exclaim. Yes, <strong>but</strong>: if you had help working through an exercise (for instance), you would make a public note of the help you needed, who helped you out, and how. How will you do this? You could make a post in your notebook about how you helped someone out - or how they helped you out. You could read someone else’s notebook about their work and perhaps that sparks a thought or idea in you. You could then write about that, and link back to your peer’s original work.</p>
<p>This collaborative community building can also happen in our private Slack space. Maybe you organize folks into a reading group. Maybe you set up a group video-chat session. All these things create a cohesive group, and I will be watching for evidence of this.</p>
<p><strong>Unacknowledged help or unacknowledged collaboration will be grounds for determining unsatisfactory work.</strong></p>
